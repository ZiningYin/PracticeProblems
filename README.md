# PracticProblems
This repo contains solutions to several leetcode problems. It includes correctness and performance testing. 
There are several solutions for of the problems, with later solutions (not ending in Original) being improvements to the intial solution.
Most of these solutions are faster than 95% of solutions in leet code, with some of them being in the 100 percentile

Solutions ending in Public are written by other people, and they are used to benchmark and compare against my approaches. The also act as a template for alternative approaches to the problem.
