# PracticProblems
This repo contains solutions to several leetcode problems. It includes correctness and performance testing. 
There are several solutions for most of the problems, with later solutions (not ending in Original) being improvements to the initial solution.
Most of these solutions are equal to or faster than 95% of the solutions in leet code

Solutions ending in Public are written by others, and they are used to benchmark and compare against my approaches. They also act as a template for alternative approaches to the problem.
